GoBox
=====

A set of extensions and components built upon the GoASAP animation platform from Moses Gunesch.

The Go ActionScript Animation Platform ("GOASAP") is a lightweight, portable set of generic base classes for building AS3 animation tools. 
Go provides structure and core functionality, but leaves the specifics to you.
